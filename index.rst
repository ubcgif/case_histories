Case Histories
==============

**Purpose of GeoSci Case Histories:** These provide the motivation for using
geophysics and show the success, or not, of their application in making an
impact upon the problem at hand.

The case histories are provided in a specific :ref:`seven_steps_index`. Hopefully this
consolidation promotes understanding about how geophysics can be used
effectively and also promote “good practise” when geophysics is adopted to
help solve other problems

This resource is Open Source and while currently being developed by brilliant
and enthusiastic graduate students and faculty at UBC, the vision is to have
experts, worldwide, contribute. Join the development on github_.
