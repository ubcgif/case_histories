:numref:`mt_milligan_tfmag` (supplied courtesy of Placer Dome Exploration) shows the
regional total-field magnetic anomaly map for an area surrounding the Mt.
Milligan copper porphyry deposit. This type of airborne data set is useful for
identifying-large scale regional geological trends. However, exploration for a
specific deposit requires more detailed information about local subsurface
distributions of rock types.

The figure inset shows the ground-based total field magnetic anomaly map over
the MBX structure. The area is 1.2 x 1.0 km with data gathered on lines spaced
50 metres apart. The data were re-sampled to 25 metres spacing along the
lines, and then the data set was upward continued to 20 metres. This was
necessary to remove features in the data that were caused by magnetic material
that was smaller than the cell size used for inversion. The ambient field was
(strength, declination, inclination)

    Total magnetic field strength map for the Mt. Milligan region, gathered by
    airborne magnetic survey techniques. In the inset, the large scale
    regional magnetic field has been removed to emphasize the signature of
    anomalous subsurface magnetically susceptible rocks.
