Mt. Milligan is a Cu-Au (copper-gold) porphyry deposit situated in north
central British Columbia. Like many deposits of this type, the individual rock
units and alteration products have physical properties that can be detected
with geophysical surveys. In particular:

 - magnetite content will alter the magnetic susceptibility; 
 - pyrite, chalcopyrite, and bornite affect chargeability; and 
 - significant mineralization and fluid-filled fractures will alter the electrical conductivity. 

Geophysical surveys have the potential to provide quantitative information
about the distribution of these physical properties. Magnetic, DC resistivity,
IP, and airborne EM data have been collected at Mt. Milligan. In this case
history the focus is upon magnetic data gathered on the ground over a 1.2 by
1.0 km area, which overlies a segment of the deposit known as the MBX East
deposit.

A 3D magnetic susceptibility model is obtained directly by inverting surface
total field anomaly data. The resulting physical property model is compared
with a rock model constructed from geologic information from 600 drill holes
and with a 3D model of gold concentration. The susceptibility model has
features that correlate with various geologic boundaries and rock units. Most
notably, the recovered susceptibility displays an anticorrelation with the
greatest gold concentration. This anticorrelation between gold concentration
and susceptibility provides an important constraint that helps define the
distribution and geochemical control of the orebody.

DC resistivity and IP surveys were also inverted, and the resulting 3D model
of chargeability displayed a positive correlation with the greatest gold
concentration. The inversion of DC and IP data are discussed in a seperate section.
