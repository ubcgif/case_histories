3. Survey
--------- 

Select a geophysical survey that is sensitive to the physical property of
relevance to the problem.  Design an effective and efficient methodolgy for
collecting the field data. This will involve forward modelling and processing
of the simulated data as well as addressing issues of noise and data quality.
This builds realistic expectations for what information can be expected from
analysis of the geophysical data and the overall suitability of the chosen
survey.
