7. Synthesis
------------

Correlate the interpretations with prior and alternative information, and
decide if your results are adequate for the particular problem. Synthesis
means making sure geophysical results agree with everything else that is known
about the problem. Also a judgement must be made about the effectiveness and
completeness of the geophysical results, and their impact upon the initial
geological, engineering, or geophysical question.
