Summary of the Seven Step Framework
-----------------------------------

 1. **Setup:** Establish the geoscience objectives, consider conventional practice, and identify how geophysics might contribute.
 2. **Properties:** Characterize materials that can be expected and establish the likely physical property contrasts.
 3. **Surveys:** Determine a suitable geophysical survey, and design an effective and efficient field survey. Identify possible sources of error, noise and mis-interpretation.
 4. **Data:** Carry out the field survey, taking all necessary actions to ensure complete, high quality, and cost effective data sets.
 5. **Processing:** Plot the data, and apply appropriate processing and analysis. 
 6. **Interpretation:** Interpret results in terms of physical property distribution, and then in terms of the original geoscience objectives.
 7. **Synthesis:** Combine interpretations with prior knowledge about the problem, and with other relevant information. Decide if your results are adequate for the particular problem. Iteration is usually necessary.
