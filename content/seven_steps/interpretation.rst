6. Interpretation
-----------------

Interpret results in terms of geological or geotechnical objectives.The goal
is to draw conclusions or make decisions based upon the geophysical data.
There are two distinct components to interpretation. The first involves
estimating how physical properties are distributed. The second involves
gaining some geological understanding based upon those physical property
distributions. Just like much of the geosciences, non-uniqueness is a
ubiquitous and  persistent characteristic of most geophysical interpretations.
