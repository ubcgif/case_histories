2. Properties
--------------

Understand how geologic and man-made materials of relevance to the problem can
be characterized by physical properties. The key is to find a physical
property of the sought object/geology  that is different from that of the
surrounding material. This is a crucial component needed to link geophysics
with the geoscience problem being investigated. Important physical properties
are:

    - Density   
    - Compressional wave and shear wave velocities  
    - Magnetic susceptibility  
    - Electrical conductivity (or resistivity) 
    - Electrical chargeability
    - Dielectric permittivity
