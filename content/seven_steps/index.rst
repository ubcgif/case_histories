Seven Step Framework
====================

Geophysics can play an important role in helping solve resource exploration,
environmental, or geotechnical problems. The application of geophysics is most
effectively carried out by following a seven-step framework. Careful thought
and due dilligence at each step is important to achieve a final outcome.

All tasks in the seven-step process are inter-related, so the distinction
between the steps can become blurred. For example, the geoscience problem will
determine an appropriate interpretation procedure, which in turn will place
constraints upon the survey design and choice of processing steps. Also, data
processing, interpretation and synthesis are often tightly related. However,
it is useful to think in terms of these seven steps because they form a
framework, which can be employed for any application of geophysical work to
applied geoscience problems.
