*What is the Problem?*
   
   Establish the geoscience objectives, consider conventional practice, and
   identify how geophysics might contribute.  This could include:

    - Mapping geology
    - Locating buried objects
    - Obtaining 3D images of the subsurface

 Assemble prior information that might be relevant. Details for using the seven-step procedure will depend upon what information is being sought and what is available.
